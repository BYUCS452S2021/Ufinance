Hey guys, I'm Jackson and I'm also interested in contributing to this project because I think I'll learn a lot in addition to being able to lend some skills to the project. I'm not a front-end or back-end master, but I am proficient in both and can help out on both sides. My current job has me using React and Node.js to access an SQL database using graphQL as a middleware Rest API which overlaps with the big-picture ideas in this class. I really like the investment aspect of this project and I think this project will be a lot of fun!
