Hey guys, I'm Jackson and I'm also interested in contributing to this project because I think I'll learn a lot in addition to being able to 
lend some skills to the project. I'm not a front-end or back-end master, but I am proficient in both and can help out on both sides. My 
current job has me using React and Node.js to access an SQL database using graphQL as a middleware Rest API which overlaps with the big-picture
 ideas in this class. I really like the investment aspect of this project and I think this project will be a lot of fun!
 The business model looks good, adhering to high legal standards to make sure we are jumping through the right hoops. Four members seems reasonable, since we will have to 
 make an intuitive front-end and a fleshed-out database.
 Using a document NoSQL database seems like a good option, especially considering that we will have to query and execute our program only once per day. 
 This project certainly has a strong social componenet since investing involves many other people.
