***UPDATE: I have joined another project, sorry***

  Hi, I’m Alexis Duncan. I am interested in joining this project because I think my skills could be useful to it. I am also mildly interested in investment. I haven’t actually invested
in anything, but I’ve been thinking about trying. This existing would help me and others do that.
  As an UI/UX emphasis student, I can help build a front end and connect it to the back end code. If that isn’t needed, I can also work on back end code. I could not help with the actual
investment knowledge part as I am not an investment person.
  This is definitely a Business operation. Once the project is done, I do not intend to work on it further. I am happy that the project is Legally held to the same standards as a human
financial advisor. I would be happy to work in the four member Operation currently planned. I agree with the Technical plans. I like the Social plans since I myself would like
something that would help me with investing money.
